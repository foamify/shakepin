## Known Issues

I started this project on 2 Aug 2024 13:09 GMT
It's only been 3 days and I just wanted to try making the main feature super quick so there's not much to see

- Only works for MacOS
- Lag when pinning files, gets worse the more files dropped
- Pasteboard gets cleared after dropping files to the app. This is due to a workaround because I tried to make it acceptable in App Store
- Multi window doesn't work because closing/hiding the sub windows will crash the whole app, no idea why
- Closing/hiding the app just minimizes it because hiding the app crashes it, no idea why
- Weird name
- Weird icon

## Future plans

I plan to make more apps and hopefully sell them.
No idea what the future plan for this project is.
